Means Clustering
A simple Machine Learning project demonstrating K-Means clustering on customer data with both a script and a basic GUI interface.

What It Does
Loads the Mall Customers dataset
Applies K-Means clustering to group customers based on features (like annual income and spending score)
Visualizes the resulting clusters
Provides a GUI for experimenting with different numbers of clusters interactively
How It Works
Data Loading

The dataset (Mall_Customers.csv) is read using pandas.
Preprocessing

Selects relevant numerical features (e.g., Annual Income, Spending Score) for clustering.
Clustering

Uses scikit-learn’s KMeans to group customers into clusters.
The user can change the number of clusters (k).
Visualization

Clusters are plotted using matplotlib.
GUI (gui.py) provides controls to input cluster count and see results dynamically.
What It Explains
This project is meant to teach/illustrate:

How unsupervised learning (clustering) works in practice
How to apply K-Means to real-world datasets
The importance of choosing the right number of clusters (k)
How visualization helps interpret ML results
How to make a simple GUI around a data science model
Dataset
Mall Customers Dataset (Mall_Customers.csv)

Contains basic customer information.
Features include:
CustomerID
Gender
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1–100)
In this project, clustering is typically done on Annual Income vs Spending Score.
